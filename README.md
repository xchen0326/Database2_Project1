To initialize how many frames are going to be created,
input a number into the args[]. Then run the program.

The main class to run in this program is the Execution class.

After hitting the run button, you can enter the commands.

IMPORTANT: when typing in the Set command, do not include "" for the new record!

For example, this is the valid input:Set 430 F05-Rec450, John Do, 23 Lake Ln, age056.

This is NOT the valid input: Set 430 "F05-Rec450, John Do, 23 Lake Ln, age056."!

Again, do not include "" when typing the Set command.
